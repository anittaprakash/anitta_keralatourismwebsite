                Being the biggest metropolis in the state and the nerve centre of commercial and industrial activities, Ernakulam offers much potential for a casu8al or shopping spree visitor. HOwever, as we are less interested in the metropolitan face of the city we drove directly to see the hill palace at Thrippunithura, which is situated a few kilometers south of the city.Ernakulam, Kerala, India

                Known as the Queen of the Arabian Sea, Kochi's charms are manifold. From the Chinese fishing nets and heritage buildings of Fort Kochi to the old spice markets of Mattancherry and the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Ernakulam, buzzing with hotels, cinema halls shops and restaurants, the city combines the finest in tradition and modernity.

              <p class="card-text"> Located in the heart of the city, Broadway is bound by a maze of alleys and crossroads. Before MG Road usurped its position as the main street, Broadway, parallel to Shanmugham Road, was the widest in town, hence its name. The narrow street and crossroads on its flanks are choc-a-block with shops selling everything under the sun from shoes, clothes, medicine, furniture, curios and kitchenware to spices, gold, hardware, electronics and books</p>

              <p class="card-text">Bhoothathankettu is among the most picturesque dams in Kerala. It is said the natural fortification of hills and forests that guard the place were built by bhoothams (spirits/ghosts). Located in Ernakulam district, it contains some of the best trekking trails in the State. Trekking through the forests here is an exhilarating experience. A boat ride here is a beautiful way to explore the natural beauty on display. Located nearby is the legendary Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary at Thattekkad.
               The two main irrigation projects of Ernakulam district - the Periyar Valley Irrigation Project and the Idamalayar are also located nearby. One can also access pedal boats and cruises in these parts. It is a wonderful picnic spot about 10 km from Kodamangalam.</p>
