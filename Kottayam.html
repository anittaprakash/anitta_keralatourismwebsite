            <p>Kottayam city is the district headquarters and an urban centre. However, by no means, can it be termed 'cosmopolitan', nor does it possess the bustle of a large city. As a local put it, 'the world seems to have bypassed Kottayam'. Chiefly known for its lakes, letters and latex, an undoubtedly unusual combination, Kottayam, in fact, is a land of many accomplishments.</p>
            <p>Ever since Benjamin Bailey set up Kerala's first printing press in Kottayam, the district has been at the forefront of the publishing industry. Today, 80 per cent of the books published in the State come from here. Kottayam is also the nerve centre of the newspaper industry - five major dailies are published from here. Today, however, Kottayam is better known for the nearby attractions of the Vembanad Lake and the backwaters of Kumarakom.</p>
            <p>The economic strength of the large Christian community, most of them owners of sprawling plantations, makes Kottayam the most prosperous town in Kerala. This is barely visible on the surface, though, as the town shuns pretensions and zealously clings to its age-old laidback ways.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title"> Kumarakom</h5>
              <p class="card-text">  The village of Kumarakom is a cluster of little islands on the Vembanad Lake, and is part of the Kuttanad region. The bird sanctuary here, which is spread across 14 acres is a favourite haunt of migratory birds and an ornithologist's paradise. Egrets, Darters, Herons, Teals, Waterfowls, Cuckoo, Wild Duck and migratory birds like the Siberian Stork visit here in flocks and fascinate all visitors.
                An enchanting backwater destination, Kumarakom offers visitors many other leisure options. Boating and fishing facilities are available at the Taj Garden Retreat, a sprawling old bungalow-turned-resort.    
                Waterscapes, the backwater resort of the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation has independent cottages built on stilts, set amidst coconut groves offering a panoramic view of the backwaters. Holiday packages involving houseboats and traditional Kettuvalloms (rice barges) offer great experiences.</p>

              <p class="card-text"> Located in Erattupetta near Kottayam, Marmala waterfall is one of the places to visit if you’re looking for some adventure. It’s difficult to reach the waterfalls as only jeeps can traverse the narrow trodden paths.
                However, all the hardship is worth the sweat for the adventure-seeking tourists. The difficult journey adds to the overall charm of these mystical falls. The beauty and the calm make up for the dangerous paths, it is also one of the best waterfalls near Kottayam to visit.</p>
