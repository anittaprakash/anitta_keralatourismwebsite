            <p> Eulogised by travellers such as Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta (who called it one of the leading trade capitals of the Old World), Kollam is where the famed network of waterways begins. The Ashtamudi Lake, known as the gateway to the backwaters, covers about 30 per cent of Kollam. From here, a 130 km long system of interlinked canals and lakes snakes up all the way to the north.

              <p class="card-text"> The marvelous beauty of Thenmala, which lies at an altitude of 1640 feet above sea level, is beyond words. We spend one full day at Thenmala enjoying th ediversified natural beauty in its full bloom. rated as one of the 64 wonderful eco-friendly places by the WTO (World Tourism Organisation) it is envisaged as an Eco-friendly Tourism project, first of this kind in India. Thenmala Eco Tourism Project located 21 kms. away from Punalur town consists of four regions. It is planed to attract travellers with different tastes. There is a Cultural zone with an amphitheatre, Musical dance fountain and stalls selling forest goods and handicrafts, operated by women’s self service societies. Another attraction is the Adventure zone where we enjoyed the adventurous mountain biking and rock climbing (even though the rock climbing was tedious all of us took the pain of it out of sheer sportsman spirit). A Leisure zone with winding forest tracks, a hanging bridge made up of coir and a sculpture garden are enjoyable not only to kids but to elders also. Apart from thsi there is a deer rehabilitation zone and a butterfly garden in Thenmala.</p>

              <p class="card-text"> On our return journey to Kollam by road we turned left after Aryankavu and rode under the canopy of greenery to reach the famous Palaruvi water falls. Though there are several waterfalls in the mountainous region of Kollam District Palaruvi is the most elegant of all. It is surrounded by a mysterious aura. The water gushes down from a high rock with a milky spray. The speed and power makes the flow milky and hence the name Palaruvi (milky stream); the waterfall has two steps. First step is its origin from a rock and the steady stream falls downward s on to a rocky pool and reemerges from there spread wide. teh total height of the fall is 300 mts. This waterfall attracted the Travancore Kings, and there were several stone mandapas built by the King, around this place. A mandapa is located high on a rock facing the water fall itself. The king used this place as a retreat from his administrative paraphermalia, it is said
