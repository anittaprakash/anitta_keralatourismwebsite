                For years, Palakkad has been the gateway to Kerala. It has provided access to the coast for conquerors and traders from the hinterland through what is known as the 'Palakkad Gap', a 40-km break in an otherwise unbroken wall of high mountains. Understandably, the region is a melting pot of cultures and cuisines, arts and music, and is known for its truly eclectic spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                A largely agrarian society in which people continue to follow in the footsteps of their forefathers, Palakkad's reputation as the granary of Iho state is borne out by its undulating paddy fields which stretch for miles. Silent Valley, Kerala's most famous forest, is located in Palakkad and remains largely untouched, making an eloquent cast; for the preservation of nature in its purest form.

However now there is the incessant music of beetles.</p>

              <p class="card-text"> Located in the heart of present-day Palakkad, this rather well preserved fort was built by Hyder Ali in 1766 ostensibly to facilitate -communication between both sides of the Western Ghats. In reality however, Hyder Ali and his son, Tipu, wished to establish their suzerainty over Kerala. The fort changed bands when the British captured it, after an 11-day siege, in 1784. Although it was later taken by the troops of the Ko/hikode Zamorin, it was recaptured by the British in 1790. Tipu Sultan, on the other hand, was not one to give up easily, but his repeated encounters with the British cost him his life. The fort then came to be known by his name.</p>

About 25 kms from Palakkad, at Nedungathpara is situated the Choolanur peacock sanctuary or Mayiladumpara, a home to hundreds of peacocks. As you reach the dense forest that sprawls over 500 hectares, piercing squawks of these beautiful birds can be heard from the bordering trees. During overcast days, the chances of witnessing the breathtaking dance of these free, wild birds are high.</p>
