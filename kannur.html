                Identified as the ancient port town of Naura, which was known even to the early Greeks and Romans, Kannur, in northern Malabar, has been famous for its exports to the outside world from very early times. Over time, it also came to be known for its quality timber. Today, the town's rich history lives on through its ancient forts, old shrines, and many venerable institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                While spices, coir, wood and sandalwood were exported from Kannur, traders from places as far flung as Sumatra and Arabia brought to the town varied merchandise - sugar, opium, dry fruits, silk, camphor, and even horses. Indeed, the celebrated Venetian traveller, Marco Polo, referred to the town as a great emporium of spice trade. Kannur has some beautiful sandy beaches, the longest of which is the Payyambalam. This beach is quiet and peaceful, perhaps because there is a Hindu burial ground nearby, where the remains of people such as EK Nayanar and AK Gopalan, the famous Communist party leaders of Kerata, are interred. The Kannur cantonment, established in 1938, is the only one in the State.

It was the citadel of the East India Company in the 17th and 18th century and the fort of Thalassery stands as an eternal monument of the colonial rule in Malabar. The British established their presence in Kerala in 1682 when they obtained permission to settle at Thalassery.</p>
