                Its criss-crossing canals and once busy waterways inevitably evoke comparisons with Venice. A prosperous trading town of yesteryears, which exported coir products to different parts of the world, Alappuzha relinquished its commercial position to other towns, notably Kochi, in later years. Today, tourism has appeared as its new saviour. Old settlers have left behind architectural treasures - numerous old mansions and trading houses built in a unique style. These buildings, along with the quiet streets and winding canals, lend this quaint town its distinctive allure.

                Situated at the south-western tip of India's longest lake, the Vembanad, Alappuzha lies sandwiched between the lake and the Arabian Sea - a sliver of land barely 4 km wide. It attracts tourists throughout the year for that singular experience of backwater cruising, especially in the Kuttanad region, a vast area of partly reclaimed land, covered in emerald green paddy fields and separated by dikes from waters that are actually a few feet higher.

              <p class="card-text">Ambalappuzha Sree Krishna Swamy Temple is an Indian Hindu temple dedicated to Krishna at Ambalappuzha in Alappuzha district of Kerala. The temple is believed to have been built during 15th century AD by the local ruler Chembakasserry Pooradam Thirunal-Devanarayanan Thampuran. It is one of the seven greatest Vaishnava temples in Travancore.
               The idol at Ambalapuzha is likened to Parthasarthi form of Vishnu, holding a whip in his right hand and a conch in his left. During the raids of Tipu Sultan in 1789, the idol of Sri Krishna from the Guruvayoor Temple was brought to the Ambalappuzha Temple for safe keeping for 12 years.</p>
